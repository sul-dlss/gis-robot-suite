	dump.rb # downloads from Solr index

	filter.rb # removes everything but OGP data that we want

        (cd opengeometadata; clone.sh) # downloads the OGM data that we want

	combine.rb data opengeometadata/edu.* # sucks in opengeometadata that we want

	upgrade.rb # converts to GeoBlacklight v1.0

	curate.rb # filters out layers we don't want

	purge.rb kurma-earthworks-v1-dev http://localhost:8983/solr '*:*' # cleans out index

	upload.rb http://localhost:8983/solr/kurma-earthworks-v1-dev geoblacklight.json # indexes
